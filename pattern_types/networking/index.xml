&lt;p&gt;The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) pattern is a distributed application architecture that eliminates the need for a central server. Instead, individual nodes (peers) in the network share resources directly with each other. Each peer acts as both a client and a server, contributing its own resources (storage, bandwidth, processing power) to the network and consuming resources from other peers. This decentralization offers benefits like increased resilience, scalability, and reduced costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where centralized control is undesirable or impractical, such as file sharing, content distribution, and collaborative systems. It&amp;rsquo;s also well-suited for applications that require high availability and can tolerate some level of inconsistency. P2P networks can be structured (with defined topologies) or unstructured (random connections), each offering different trade-offs in terms of efficiency and robustness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="usage"&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File Sharing:&lt;/strong&gt; Applications like BitTorrent rely heavily on P2P to distribute large files efficiently. Users download pieces of a file from multiple peers simultaneously, reducing the load on any single source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies:&lt;/strong&gt; Blockchain technologies, like those powering Bitcoin and Ethereum, are fundamentally P2P. Transactions are broadcast to the network and validated by multiple peers, ensuring security and transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized Social Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Platforms like Mastodon utilize P2P principles through federated servers (instances) that communicate with each other, allowing users to interact across different communities without a single point of control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative Editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Some real-time collaborative editing tools use P2P to synchronize changes between users directly, reducing latency and improving responsiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="examples"&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BitTorrent:&lt;/strong&gt; A widely used protocol for P2P file sharing. Users download and upload file segments concurrently, creating a swarm of peers that collectively distribute the content. The tracker initially helps peers find each other, but the actual file transfer happens directly between peers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):&lt;/strong&gt; A P2P hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Content is addressed by its hash, and nodes store and serve content based on demand, creating a distributed content-addressable storage system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WebRTC:&lt;/strong&gt; A free and open-source project that provides real-time communication capabilities directly between browsers and mobile applications. It uses P2P connections for audio and video streaming, eliminating the need for a dedicated signaling server for media transfer (though signaling is still required for connection setup).&lt;/li&gt;
